# Go HTTP projects: CI

General conventions for Go HTTP API projects. Where this project's own code or
CLAUDE.md differs, follow the project.

## When

CI lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Add it once any feature in the project
reaches Alpha (see the `stability` skill), and add jobs as features reach the
level that calls for them. Don't add Beta jobs while every feature is still
Alpha.

## Workflow

- Run on pushes to `main` and on pull requests.
- Set `permissions: contents: read`.
- Set up Go with `actions/setup-go` and `go-version-file: go.mod`.
- CI only checks. It never commits, pushes, or opens pull requests with fixes,
  and it never publishes images.

## Jobs

| Job | Level | Steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check` | Alpha | `go vet ./...`; golangci-lint through `golangci/golangci-lint-action`, using the project's `.golangci.yml` if there is one; `go fmt ./...` and `go fix ./...`, then `git diff --exit-code` so the job fails if either changed anything; `go build ./...`. |
| `docker-build` | Alpha, only if the project has a Dockerfile | `docker build .`, without pushing. |
| `feature-test` | Alpha | Start the dependencies with the project's local stack (`docker compose up -d --wait`), start the app and wait until it responds, then `npm ci` and `npx playwright test tests/feature`. Install Playwright browsers only if the tests use a browser. |
| `unit-test` | Beta | `go test ./...` |
| `integration-test` | Beta | Start the dependencies the tests need with `docker compose up -d --wait <services>`, then `go test -tags integration ./...`. |

Pass dependency connection details and the app's URL to tests through the same
environment variables used locally (see the testing rule), so CI and local runs
behave the same way.
